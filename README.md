C codes really simple samples made with the MSXGL Library.

mcu_3sprites.c and mcu_3sprites60degrees.c animate sprites, the former with two sprites at 180 degrees and the latter with three sprites at 60 degrees. 
Both use trigonometric tables.

fillVRAMSC1_example2.c applies VDP_FillVRAM_16K function

directPSGaccess.c makes a sound when pressing the space bar

Akg_music_play.c plays an akg song defined in teste1pos.h.

writesc5.c writes messages to screen5 (still in progress)
